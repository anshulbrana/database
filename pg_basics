-- 1. How can you produce a list of all facilities with the word 'Tennis' in their name?

SELECT * FROM cd.facilities fac
WHERE fac.name LIKE '%Tennis%'

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- 2. How can you retrieve the details of facilities with ID 1 and 5? Try to do it without using the OR operator.

SELECT * FROM  cd.facilities fac 
WHERE fac.facid IN (1,5);

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- 3. How can you produce a list of facilities, with each labelled as 'cheap' or 'expensive' 
depending on if their monthly maintenance cost is more than $100? Return the name and monthly maintenance of the facilities in question.
(case statement)

select name,
case when monthlymaintenance > 100 then 'expensive'
else 'cheap'
end as cost
from cd.facilities

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- 4. You, for some reason, want a combined list of all surnames and all facility names. Yes, this is a contrived example :-). Produce that list!
(using union)

select surname from cd.members 
union
select name from cd.facilities
